                    <p>Mix into chicken and water to make a very thin batter.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Add chicken to the flour bowl and toss and press until completely dredged in mixture.</p> 
                    <p>Place on the prepared wire rack until ready to fry.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</p>
                    <p>Line a second rimmed baking sheet with paper towels, and place a clean wire rack on top.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Add chicken pieces to the hot oil about 5 pieces at a time so as not to drop the temperature of the oil.</p>

                    <p>Carefully add the first batch of cooked chicken and fry again until cooked through and crispy, about 5 minutes more.</p> 
                    <p>Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.</p>

                    <p>Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat. </p>
                    <p>Add sesame oil, grated garlic, grated ginger, brown sugar, gochujang paste, vinegar, and 1/2 cup water.</p> 
                    <p>Cook and stir continuously until sugar has melted and sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes.</p> 
                    <p>Drizzle sauce over twice-fried chicken pieces, garnish with sesame seed and peanuts, and serve.</p>
